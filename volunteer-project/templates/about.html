<div id = "about">
	<div id = "text">Welcome to iVolunteer! iVolunteer was born in the summer of 2016 of the Google Computer Science Summer Institute (CSSI) Program in the Chicago office. Driven by their past experiences in struggling to find diverse volunteering opportunities, three rising college freshmen founded this webapp as a platform of connecting volunteers to organizations.

    Our mission is to make volunteering opportunities more easily accessible to people who want to give back and make an impact in all corners of the community. Seeking to make volunteering an option for everyone, our "win-win" philosophy matches individuals with events hosted by local organizations.</div>
